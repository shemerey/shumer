# Shumer

A highly tuned ruby on rails vim distribution

## introduction

this is my personal vim distribution that i have tweaked over time and evolved from a simple vanilla vimrc configuration to a full-blown distribution that it is today.

## installation

1.  clone this repository into your `~/.vim` directory
1.  `git submodule init && git submodule update`
1.  `ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc`
1.  startup vim and neobundle will detect and ask you install any missing plugins.  you can also manually initiate this with `:NeoBundleInstall`
1.  done!

## standard modifications

*  if you have either [ack](http://betterthangrep.com/) or [ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) installed, they will be used for `grepprg`
*  all temporary files are stored in `~/.vim/.cache`, such as backup files and persistent undo

## mappings

### insert mode
*  `<C-h>` move the cursor left
*  `<C-l>` move the cursor right
*  `jk`,`kj` "smash escape"

### normal mode
*  `<leader>fef` format entire file
*  `<leader>f$` strip current line of trailing white space
*  window shortcuts
  *  `<leader>v` vertical split
  *  `<leader>s` horizontal split
  *  `<leader>vsa` vertically split all buffers
  *  `<C-h>` `<C-j>` `<C-k>` `<C-l>` move to window in the direction of hkjl
*  window killer
  *  `Q` remapped to close windows and delete the buffer (if it is the last buffer window)
* searching
  *  `<leader>fw` find the word under cursor into the quickfix list
  *  `<leader>ff` find the last search into the quickfix list
  *  `/` replaced with `/\v` for sane regex searching
  *  `<cr>` toggles hlsearch
*  `<Down>` `<Up>` maps to `:bprev` and `:bnext` respectively
*  `<Left>` `<Right>` maps to `:tabprev` and `:tabnext` respectively
*  `gp` remapped to visually reselect the last paste
*  `gb` for quick going to buffer
*  `<leader>l` toggles `list` and `nolist`
*  profiling shortcuts
   * `<leader>DD` starts profiling all functions and files into a file `profile.log`
   * `<leader>DP` pauses profiling
   * `<leader>DC` continues profiling
   * `<leader>DQ` finishs profiling and exits vim

### visual mode
*  `<leader>s` sort selection
*  `>` and `<` automatically reselects the visual selection

## plugins

### [unite.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim)
*  this is an extremely powerful plugin that lets you build up lists from arbitrary sources
*  mappings
  *  `<space><space>` go to anything (files, buffers, MRU, bookmarks)
  *  `<space>y` select from previous yanks

### [bufkill.vim](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1147)
*  `<leader>bd` or `:BD` will kill a buffer without changing the window layout

### [easymotion](https://github.com/skwp/vim-easymotion)
*  easily jumps to any character on the screen
*  `<leader><leader>w` or `<leader><leader>e` will do the trick, along with any of the other default bindings that plugin has mapped under `<leader><leader>`
*  this is a forked version of [lokaltog](https://github.com/skwp/vim-easymotion)'s version which uses vimperator style double keystrokes

### [easygrep](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2438)
*  makes search/replacing in your project a lot easier without relying on `find` and `sed`
*  `<leader>vv` find word under the cursor
*  `<leader>vV` find whole word under the cursor
*  `<leader>vr` perform global search replace of word under cursor, with confirmation
*  `<leader>vR` same as vr, but matches whole word
